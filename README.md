# cmd-writer-Animation
## this is a simple and fun project that can be added as an intro to your website or in the homepage
### to use it just add a div and it's class is 'consolewriter' ( you can customize this class css as you want) you can add whatever tags (with classes and id if you want) you want in the div but nested tags like lists arent supported currently and the break line is the only supported empty tag 
 ####also add cmdwriter.js to your project and add this code to your CSS file

```
.cursor{
	color: white !important;
	-webkit-animation: -webkit-cursor 1s both ease infinite;
	animation: cursor 1s both ease infinite;
}
@-webkit-keyframes cursor {
	0% { opacity:1;}
	50%{opacity:0;}
	100%{opacity:1;}
	
}
@keyframes cursor {
	0% { opacity:1;}
	50%{opacity:0;}
	100%{opacity:1;}
	
}
```
